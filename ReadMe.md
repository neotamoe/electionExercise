Neota Moe - Code Challenge Submission
-------

Thank you for the opportunity to do this code challenge.  I enjoyed the challenge and using Angular components.  I commented the code for added clarity.  My IDE indents code differently than the code provided so I corrected the formatting on all files to indent consistently across files.

I look forward to your feedback and speaking with you more.

## Features
* Responsive using Bootstrap
* Edit candidate name
* Add or edit candidate image

## Reflection
Though my primary projects at Prime were done in AngularJS, components are new to me.  Despite that, I was able to get most tasks/features (as indicated in the instructions) to work successfully, but had to create a workaround in order to get the percentages calculated in the results table.  I made multiple attempts trying different bindings, requires and other strategies.  I tested availability of the candidates array by using console logs.  Ultimately I opted to do the workaround to get the functionality complete rather than leave it unfinished.  

I read a lot about components through the course of completing the challenge, but would love the opportunity to receive feedback and constructive criticism on the code I am submitting.
