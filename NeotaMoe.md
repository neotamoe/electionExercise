Neota Moe - Code Challenge Submission
-------

Thank you for the opportunity to do this code challenge.  I enjoyed the challenge and using Angular components.  I commented the code for added clarity.  My IDE indents code differently than the code provided so I corrected the formatting on all files to indent consistently across files.

I look forward to your feedback and speaking with you more.
